# Edge-Detection-for-Digitizing-Surface-Roughness
This project presents a MATLAB function for generating digital elevation models (DEM) from overlapping images of a rock surface. The code reads the images, extracts the edges of a structured laser light using Canny edge detection method. The extracted edges form a point cloud of the surface. The point cloud represent the DEM of the surface.
